To connect idd.x to GitHub Pages:

1. Set a CNAME record to: <your-username>.github.io
2. Or use an A record to GitHub Pages IPs: 185.199.108.153, .154, .155, .156
3. Add a file named 'CNAME' with 'idd.x' inside the repository root if using Pages.

For ENS/IPFS, consider using services like Fleek or Web3Host.
